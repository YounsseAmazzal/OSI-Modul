### The Transport Layer 
The Transport Layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications. It ensures complete data transfer, error recovery, and flow control between hosts. This layer segments and reassembles data for efficient transmission and provides reliability with error detection and correction mechanisms.

Protocols at this layer include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is connection-oriented and ensures reliable data transfer with error checking and flow control, making it suitable for applications like web browsing and email. UDP is connectionless, offering faster, though less reliable, transmission, suitable for applications like video streaming and online gaming.
