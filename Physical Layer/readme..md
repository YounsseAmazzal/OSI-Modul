### The Physical Layer
The Physical Layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It defines the hardware elements involved in the network, including cables, switches, and other physical components. This layer also specifies the electrical, optical, and radio characteristics of the network.

Functions of the Physical Layer include the modulation, bit synchronization, and transmission of raw binary data over the physical medium. Technologies such as Fiber Optics and Wi-Fi operate at this layer, ensuring that the data physically moves from one device to another in the network.
