### What Is the OSI Model?
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. The OSI model is divided into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, ranging from physical hardware connections to high-level application interactions.

Each layer of the OSI model interacts with the layer directly above and below it, encapsulating and transmitting data in a structured manner. This approach helps network professionals troubleshoot issues, as problems can be isolated to a specific layer. The OSI model serves as a universal language for networking, providing a common ground for different systems to communicate effectively.

The OSI model was the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies in the early 1980s. It was introduced in 1983 by representatives of the major computer and telecom companies, and was adopted by ISO as an international standard in 1984.

The modern Internet is not based on OSI, but on the simpler TCP/IP model. However, the OSI 7-layer model is still widely used, as it helps visualize and communicate how networks operate.

### Why Is the OSI Model Important?
The OSI model provides several advantages for organizations managing networks and communications:

Shared understanding of complex systems: OSI offers a universal language for networking, enabling different network devices and software to communicate. By dividing communication into seven distinct layers, it allows network professionals to isolate and troubleshoot problems effectively.
Faster research and development: Developers can focus on improving specific layers without affecting others, leading to more rapid innovations. This modular approach enables specialization and enables different teams to work on various aspects of network communication simultaneously.
Flexible standardization: The model’s layered approach allows for the integration of new technologies at any layer without disrupting the overall network structure. This ensures compatibility across different devices and protocols, ensuring long-term viability and scalability of network infrastructure.

How Does Communication Happen in the OSI Model? A Practical Example
Let’s consider how OSI layers play a role in an everyday activity like sending an email to a person overseas:

When a user in New York sends an email to a colleague in London, the process starts at the Application Layer (Layer 7). The user’s email client, such as Outlook, uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to handle the email message.
The email is then passed to the Presentation Layer (Layer 6), where it is formatted and encrypted to ensure proper transmission.
Next, the email moves to the Session Layer (Layer 5), where a session is established between the sender’s email server in New York and the receiver’s email server in London. This layer manages the session, keeping the connection open long enough to send the email.
The email data then reaches the Transport Layer (Layer 4), where it is divided into smaller packets. TCP ensures these packets are sent reliably and in the correct order.
At the Network Layer (Layer 3), each packet is assigned source and destination IP addresses, allowing it to be routed through multiple networks, including routers and switches, to reach the recipient in London.
The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) then uses MAC addresses to handle the packets’ journey across local networks and correcting any errors that occur.
Finally, the Physical Layer (Layer 1) converts the data into electrical signals, which are transmitted over fiber-optic cables under the Atlantic Ocean.
Upon reaching the recipient’s server in London, the process is reversed:

The Physical Layer converts the signals back into data packets, which are reassembled at the Data Link Layer.
The Network Layer ensures the packets have arrived correctly, and the Transport Layer reorders them if necessary.
The Session Layer maintains the session until the email is fully received.
The Presentation Layer decrypts and formats the email, and the Application Layer delivers the email to the client, where it appears in their inbox.
Advantages of OSI Model
The OSI model helps users and operators of computer networks:

Determine the required hardware and software to build their network.
Understand and communicate the process followed by components communicating across a network.
Perform troubleshooting, by identifying which network layer is causing an issue and focusing efforts on that layer.
The OSI model helps network device manufacturers and networking software vendors:

Create devices and software that can communicate with products from any other vendor, allowing open interoperability
Define which parts of the network their products should work with.
Communicate to users at which network layers their product operates – for example, only at the application layer, or across the stack.
