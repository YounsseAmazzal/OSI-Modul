### The Network Layer
The Network Layer is responsible for data routing, forwarding, and addressing. It determines the best physical path for data to reach its destination based on network conditions, the priority of service, and other factors. This layer manages logical addressing through IP addresses and handles packet forwarding.

Key protocols at this layer include the Internet Protocol (IP), which is important for routing and addressing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes, and routing protocols like Routing Information Protocol (RIP) that manage the routing of data across networks.
