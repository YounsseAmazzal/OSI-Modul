### The Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and correction. It ensures that data is transmitted to the correct device on a local network segment. This layer manages MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and is divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).

Protocols and technologies at this layer include Ethernet, which defines the rules for data transmission over local area networks (LANs), and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for direct connections between two network nodes. It also includes mechanisms for detecting and possibly correcting errors that may occur in the Physical Layer.
