### The Session Layer
The Session Layer manages and controls the connections between computers. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections, ensuring that data exchanges occur efficiently and in an organized manner. The layer is responsible for session checkpointing and recovery, which allows sessions to resume after interruptions.

Protocols operating at the Session Layer include Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which enables a program to execute a procedure on a remote host as if it were local, and the session establishment phase in protocols like NetBIOS and SQL. These services enable reliable communication, especially in complex network environments.
