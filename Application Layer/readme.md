### The Application Layer 
The Application Layer serves as the interface between the end-user applications and the underlying network services. This layer provides protocols and services that are directly utilized by end-user applications to communicate across the network. Key functionalities of the Application Layer include resource sharing, remote file access, and network management.

Examples of protocols operating at the Application Layer include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for web browsing, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for file transfers, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email services, and Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving domain names to IP addresses. These protocols ensure that user applications can effectively communicate with each other and with servers over a network.
