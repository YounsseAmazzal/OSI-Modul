## The Presentation Layer
The Presentation Layer, also known as the syntax layer, is responsible for translating data between the application layer and the network format. It ensures that data sent from the application layer of one system is readable by the application layer of another system. This layer handles data formatting, encryption, and compression, facilitating interoperability between different systems.

One of the key roles of the Presentation Layer is data translation and code conversion. It transforms data into a format that the application layer can understand. For example, it may convert data from ASCII to EBCDIC. It also includes encryption protocols to ensure data security during transmission and compression protocols to reduce the amount of data for efficient transmission.
